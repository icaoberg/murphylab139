function [y,offset,scale] = ml_libsvmnorm(x)
%ML_LIBSVMNORM Normalize features for lib svm.
%   Y = ML_LIBSVMNORM(X) returns the normalized feature matrix of X. Each 
%   feature is normalized into the range [-1 1].
%   
%   [Y,OFFSET,SCALE] = ML_LIBSVMNORM(...) also returns the offset and scale to
%   normalize the features.
